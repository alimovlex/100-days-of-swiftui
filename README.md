**SwiftUI** is a powerful framework for building user-interactive apps for iOS, macOS, tvOS, and even watchOS. But you can’t build software without having a programming language, so behind SwiftUI lies Swift itself: a powerful, flexible, and modern programming language that you’ll use for all your SwiftUI apps.

As Mark Twain once said, “the secret to getting ahead is getting started.”
